## OpenXrypt: Secure and Private Direct Messaging for Social Media

OpenXrypt is a Chrome extension that provides secure and encrypted communication on social media platforms. It utilizes the OpenPGP encryption standard to help protect the privacy of your communications and ensure the confidentiality of sensitive information.

## Compatible Platforms

- Twitter DMs
- Whatsapp Web

## The Importance of Secure Communication

Social media platforms have become integral parts of our daily lives, facilitating real-time communication, information sharing, and community building. However, the inherent nature of these platforms often raises concerns regarding user privacy and data security. Unencrypted messages and personal information are susceptible to unauthorized ads and access, potential surveillance and/or data breaches, posing significant risks to individuals and organizations.

OpenXrypt recognizes the critical need for secure communication channels, particularly in an era where privacy violations and data mishandling have become increasingly prevalent. By offering robust encryption capabilities, OpenXrypt aims to empower users to engage in secure conversations, share sensitive information, and express themselves freely without the fear of unauthorized monitoring or interception.

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Encryption:** Encrypts messages using OpenPGP to ensure only the sender and recipient can access the content.
- **Automatic Encryption and Decryption:** OpenXrypt seamlessly integrates with the compatible platforms, automatically encrypting and decrypting messages using OpenPGP standards, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected during transmission and storage.
- **Group Messages Encryption** You can encrypt messages on X and Whatsapp groups by just having all participants public keys registered.
- **Passphrase Management:** Users can securely set, reset, and manage their passphrases, enabling them to maintain control over their encryption keys and ensure the confidentiality of their communications.
- **Key Management:** OpenXrypt provides a user-friendly interface for adding, editing, and deleting GPG public and private keys, allowing users to manage their encryption keys and those of their contacts with ease.
- **Timeline Obfuscation**: OpenXrypt enhances your privacy by obfuscating your timeline, making it hard for algorithms to use your content for AI training or targeted advertising. Your posts will be symmetrically encrypted with a SHA-256 hash of your public key's fingerprint, ensuring your content remains public but more secure.
